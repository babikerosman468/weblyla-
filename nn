Perfect â€” now the authentication is working âœ…, and Git is connecting to the correct repo (weblyla-).

The new issue is:

Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally.

This happens because your GitHub repo weblyla- already has at least one commit (maybe the README or an initial commit), so Git refuses to push your local commits until you sync with the remote.

Step 1 â€” Pull the remote changes

Since this is the first push from your side, you can do a pull with rebase:

git pull --rebase origin main

This will fetch the remote commits and apply your local commits on top.

If there are no conflicts, it will finish automatically.



---

Step 2 â€” Push after rebase

git push -u origin main

This should succeed and your local changes will be uploaded.


---

ðŸ’¡ Optional: If you want, I can update your push.sh script so it automatically:

1. Pulls with rebase if needed


2. Pushes the first commit


3. Works with HTTPS + PAT



So you wonâ€™t run into these issues again.

Do you want me to do that?
